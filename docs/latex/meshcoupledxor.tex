\subsection{Mesh-Coupled Xor TRNG}

The Mesh-Coupled XOR TRNG proposed by Lu et. al. is an autonomous boolean network designed 
based on first principles established by Gong et. al. that fundamentally uses several ring oscillators,
coupled XOR gates, and a mesh network topology to generate a chaotic-like entropy source. 
The autonomous boolean network mechanism, similar to work done by Rosin and Zhang and collaborators, 
allows for the use of nonlinear dynamics and chaos to expose the hardware fabric's manufacturing 
variance as an entropy source. 

The entropy source here is derived from the unpredictability of boolean chaos. As chaos is defined by
its sensitivity to initial conditions, the initial conditions are unknowable with infinite precision,
and as such, a security system with a chaotic entropy source can be assumed to be more secure. However,
proving chaotic behavior of a system is a hard problem, so no claims are made that chaos is guaranteed
present, though it is assumed due to its similarity to work by Rosin and Zhang.

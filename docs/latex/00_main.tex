        TRNGs are a fundamental component in security systems, though often are proprietary and closed source.
        The impact cost of a vulnerability in a TRNG's entropy source, especially one integrated on chip, can 
        often be astronomical. Meanwhile, open-source systems have the benefit of additional scrutiny and 
        availability, reducing cost while potentially increasing security, benefitting the consumer. This
        paper provides a catalog of open-source implementations of entropy sources designed from varying 
        first principles implemented on an AMD FPGA, providing a first step toward open-source secure random 
        number generation, and toward security through transparency.

	abstract = {Many applications require unpredictable randomly generated numbers. This paper presents a lightweight architecture of a high speed true random number generator (TRNG) and its ASIC implementation. The proposed TRNG randomness is extracted from the observation of the final state of a chain of bistable elements after putting them in a metastable state. The ASIC design methodology targets the CMOS 65 nm technology from STMicroelectronics (STM). It allows to validate the TRNG behavior and evaluate the randomness in different working conditions. Results of standard statistical tests are also presented to validate the TRNG ASIC structure.},

	abstract = {This letter presents a high-performance true random number generator (TRNG) based on self-timed ring (STR), showing robust tolerance to PVT variations. The evaluations were performed over 320 chips (64 chips per process corner of nn, ff, ss, sf, and fs) across three voltages (0.75 V, 0.75 V±10\%) and three temperatures ( - 40 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ }}$ C, 25 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ }}$ C, and 150 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ }}$ C). All 320 test chips demonstrated stable random generation at 60 Mb/s over all the test combinations without a single failure. The verification utilized a TRNG BIST, ensuring a minimum of 0.5 min-entropy per bit. Moreover, a mathematical model for the proposed TRNG is developed to derive the throughput and the entropy of the random output.},

	abstract = {The true random number generator is capable of generating completely random and unpredictable sequences, and plays a crucial role in various fields such as cryptography, encryption communication, and random algorithms. To meet the demand for high-throughput true random number generators in modern high-speed systems, a lightweight TRNG design is proposed. It utilizes a mesh topology of coupled-XOR as entropy source and generates a highly compact and high throughput true random number generator by coupling oscillators in the network. The generated random sequences have successfully passed the NIST SP 800-22, TESTU01, NIST SP 800-90B, and AIS-31 tests. It achieved ultra-high throughput of 2.1Gbps and 2.4Gbps on the Xilinx Artix-7 and Kintex-7 series development boards, respectively, achieving efficient utilization of hardware resources. Compared with other works, this design has significant advantages in terms of resource utilization and throughput.},

	abstract = {To analyze the unpredictability of Boolean chaos, the model for chaotic circuit system based on autonomous Boolean network is established. In addition, the equations of the Boolean network with propagation time jitter are deduced. By considering the jitter of propagation time because of phase noise, the time for the growth of entropy for an ensemble of trajectories is analyzed. It is demonstrated that Boolean chaos will be unpredictable after tens of nanoseconds, and less average time for the growth of entropy is required as the jitter strength increased. It is shown that Boolean chaos has physical randomness because of phase noise and it also lays the theoretical foundation for the entropy source of true random number generator using chaotic Boolean network.},

The resulting power spectrum is ultra-wide-band, extending from dc to beyond 2 GHz. The observed behavior is reproduced qualitatively using an autonomously updating Boolean model with signal propagation times that depend on the recent history of the gates and filtering of pulses of short duration, whose presence is confirmed experimentally. Electronic Boolean chaos may find application as an ultra-wide-band source of radio waves},

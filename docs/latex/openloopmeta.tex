\subsection{Open-Loop Metastable TRNG}

The open-loop metastable TRNG proposed by Ben-Romdhane et. al. is designed such that a cascade
of delay elements on the clock and data path can be used to produce a
single bit of randomness by forcing a flop at the end to be metastable. Several 
implementations of this concept have been implemented within
the literature at [add sources here], but the contribution of Ben-Romdhane et. al. was
to implement a version of this concept targeting ASICs. 

The primary mechanism for inducing metastability involves using two multiplexor chains
to calibrate the TRNG such that the delay induced through each multiplexor chain causes
several of the flops in the sampling flop chain to go metastable. This is a similar 
concept to oscillator-based TRNGs, as they ideally capture transition points within the
oscillator signal, except that the premise here is less about the jitter of the signal,
but rather the flop's internal sampling structure settling finally on '0' or '1'.

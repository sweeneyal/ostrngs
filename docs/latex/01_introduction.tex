\section{Introduction}

Secure true random number generation is an important problem for the security of communication, 
in order to ensure the fundamental requirements of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and
non-repudiation. Random numbers are used extensively in cryptography, such as the recent
post-quantum cryptographic public key encryption algorithm, ML-KEM. The widespread need for random
number generation has led to dozens of publications proposing implementations of entropy sources
based on metastability, jitter, thermal noise, and chaos. This work seeks to catalog several of these 
entropy sources, discuss their implementations, and provide open access to all entropy sources in this 
catalog. In addition to the implementation source, a demonstration platform targeting common AMD FPGA 
platforms is provided in parallel for further evaluation of each entropy source's implementation. Finally, 
min-entropy estimates using NIST SP 800-90B on each entropy source are performed, provided, and discussed
at length.

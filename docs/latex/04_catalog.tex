\section{Catalog of Entropy Sources}

As the primary purpose of this work is to investigate several architectures of entropy sources, an initial 
sampling of entropy sources was selected that ran the gamut of recent research, ranging from metastability
generated by tuned delay lines, to autonomous oscillators, to chaotic autonomous boolean networks with 
complex dynamics. This section aims to present each collected entropy source and the implementation and 
results as presented by the authors.

# Integration Help

When integrating the IP in this repository to your application, there are two expected routes:

1. AXI-Based Integration
2. Direct Integration

## Integration with MicroBlaze

Use this link first to build the MicroBlaze: https://github.com/viktor-nikolov/MicroBlaze-DDR3-tutorial

Use this link second to build the application around the MicroBlaze: https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/getting-started-with-ipi#launch_vitis

Once the above two steps are done, we can then build an application with the TRNG testbed implemented.

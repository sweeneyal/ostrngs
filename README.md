# Open Source True Random Number Generators (OSTRNGs)

The OSTRNGs project is an effort to provide both my graduate research and access to entropy sources as a whole to the 
academic, industry, and security community at large. It provides a number of entropy sources as well as the plumbing
required to interface to them from AXI for seamless integration, or the de-AXI-fied version for direct integration into
other RTL.
